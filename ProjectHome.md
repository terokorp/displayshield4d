Simple but powerfull library to use the **4Display-Shield** board series from 4D Systems.

**Library works for:
  1. [4Display-Shield-96](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/prod.php?id=124)
  1. [4Display-Shield-128](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/prod.php?id=125)
  1. [4Display-Shield-160](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/prod.php?id=126)
  1. [4Display-Shield-144](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/prod.php?id=127)**

Here is the 4Display-Shield-160 model:

The 4Display-Shield-160 provides an easy way of interfacing the popular uOLED-160-G1 display module to the Arduino-Duemilanove, the Arduino-Mega and many other Arduino compatible boards. The unit comes complete with the uOLED-160-G1 module, a 5 way multiswitch joystick and male headers that help connect the 4Display-Shield to the Arduino boards. The 5 position joystick is connected to the Arduino D2, D3, D4, D5 and D6 pins. The communication interface between the 4Display-Shield and the Arduino is via the Serial UART. Both the TX and RX signals are jumpered on the shield PCB so that the Arduino UART can be freed-up when it's being programmed.

The uOLED-160-G1 module is integrated with a 1.7" full colour 160x128 pixel resolution OLED screen, tiny yet poweful GOLDELOX graphics controller chip and a micro-SD connector which supports standard and high-capacity memory cards. The memory card can be used to store images, icons, video clips and data logging.

These boards come preloaded with the SGC (serial) firmware. The library was tested on the **Arduino IDE 0021** and **Arduino UNO** board.
